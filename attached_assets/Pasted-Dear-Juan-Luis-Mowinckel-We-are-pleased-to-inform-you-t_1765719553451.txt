Dear Juan Luis Mowinckel,

We are pleased to inform you that we have successfully received the form authorizing the use of Golfmanager's API to Hostkeeping.com AG.

We would like to notify you that the connection will be available within 24 to 48 hours, at which time we will send you a confirmation email to notify you that the process has been completed successfully. A prerequisite for completing the connection is that either a client must be created (in the case of an API Consumer) or an administrator user must be created (in the case of an API Admin).

Please note that we kindly ask all parties involved to wait the full 48 hours before reaching out to confirm whether the connection has been activated, as this is a reasonable timeframe for completing the setup process.

The submitted form data is included below for your reference.
We appreciate your trust in our services and remain at your disposal for any additional inquiries.

Best regards,

Golfmanager Support
